        <h2 class="card-title">About Me</h2>
        <h4 class="card-text">Background</h4>
        <ul class="card-text">
          <li>Education</li>
          <p>I graduated from Gladstone High School in 2011, and attended Clackamas Community College from Winter term of 2017 to Spring term of 2018.</p>
          <li>Job History</li>
          <p>I was a Co-owner of a Brainstorm Games from 2014 to 2017. Starting in 2018 after my time a CCC, I started playing professional golf. I currently am a delivery expert for Domino's while I attend Epicodus.</p>
          <li>Why I chose Epicodus</li>
          <p>I chose Epicodus to try and give myself and future family a better and more consistent life. Professional golf was a ton of fun, but by nature, doesn't provide the most consistent living.</p>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="card-text">Current Interests</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Hobbies</li>
          <p>I enjoy playing tabletop games, I love watching football, basketball, and golf! I also enjoy spending time outside hiking and camping!</p>
          <li>Skills</li>
          <p>I feel that my most of my skills are also my hobbies, but an additional skill I have is being a good cook. I love to make steak, and pretty much any type of grilled meat!</p>
